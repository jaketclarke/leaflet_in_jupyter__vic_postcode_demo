# Jupyter ipyleaflet demo

This project is a short demo using Jupyter notebooks to clean up some data and make a leaflet map

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Be running Jupyter. I use the anaconda installer: https://www.continuum.io/downloads

You'll also need to install each of the libraries listed below, if you don't have them

```
ipyleaflet
pandas
json
matplotlib
numpy
```

You can install them using pip by running something like:
```
windows: open the annaconda prompt, remebering to run as admin, and type: `pip install ipyleaflet`
linux: sudo -H pip install ipyleaflet
``` 

## using it

It's a Jupyter notebook, go nuts
