# Jupyter ipyleaflet demo

This project is a short demo using Jupyter notebooks to clean up some data and make a leaflet map

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Be running Jupyter. I use the anaconda installer: https://www.continuum.io/downloads

You'll also need to install each of the libraries listed below, if you don't have them

```
ipyleaflet
pandas
json
matplotlib
numpy
```

You can install them using pip by running something like below

Windows: Open the annaconda prompt, remebering to run as admin
```
pip install ipyleaflet
```
Linux:
```
sudo -H pip install ipyleaflet
```
or, if you have both python2 and 3 and need to install it with 
```
sudo -H pip3 install ipyleaflet
```
